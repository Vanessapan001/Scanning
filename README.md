# Scanning and Internal Reconnaissance

Now that we are inside the network of our target, we will now perform reconnaissance inside the internal network, known as **active reconnaissance**, in order to reveal which devices are on the network and what potential new targets await.

- We call this **active reconnaissance** because we are now directly interacting with our target.
- It is also considered **internal reconnaissance** because we are conducting this *internally* within the target. 
- While inside the network, we can gather the following:
    - Information about the host, known as **host enumeration**.
    - Information about processes on the system, known as **process enumeration**.
    - Information about the users on the system.


# Scanning

Additionally, we can more aggressively gather information through a process called **scanning**.

 - **Scanning** is the second phase of a pen testing engagement, after Planning and Reconnaissance. Scanning uses tools to gather information such as network information and potential vulnerabilities.
 - While in our example we will scan our target from inside their network, scanning can also be conducted externally and before initial access.
 - **Nessus**, **Hping**, and **Nmap** are tools which we often utilize to conduct scanning.
